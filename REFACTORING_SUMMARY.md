# BearTrak Search API Environment Variables Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring completed to standardize all environment variables with the `BEARTRAK_` prefix to avoid contamination from other project environment variables and eliminate the use of the generic `PORT` variable.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variables Updated

All environment variables now use the `BEARTRAK_` prefix:

#### Before (Old Variables):
- `ENVIRONMENT` → `BEARTRAK_ENVIRONMENT`
- `DEBUG` → `BEARTRAK_DEBUG`
- `HOST` → `BEARTRAK_HOST`
- `PORT` → **ELIMINATED** (replaced with specific port variables)
- `PRODUCTION_PORT` → `BEARTRAK_PRODUCTION_PORT`
- `DEVELOPMENT_PORT` → `BEARTRAK_DEVELOPMENT_PORT`
- `DATABASE_URL` → `BEARTRAK_DATABASE_URL`
- `PRODUCTION_DB` → `BEARTRAK_PRODUCTION_DB`
- `DEVELOPMENT_DB` → `BEARTRAK_DEVELOPMENT_DB`
- `CORS_ORIGINS` → `BEARTRAK_CORS_ORIGINS`
- `TEST_SERVER_PORT` → `BEARTRAK_TEST_SERVER_PORT`

#### After (New Variables):
All variables are prefixed with `BEARTRAK_` as shown above.

### 2. Files Modified

#### Configuration Files:
- **`.env`**: Updated all variable names to use `BEARTRAK_` prefix
- **`database.py`**: Updated to use `BEARTRAK_` prefixed environment variables
- **`main.py`**: Updated to use `BEARTRAK_` prefixed variables and removed generic PORT handling

#### Build & Development:
- **`Makefile`**: Updated port configuration and integration test variables
- **`README.md`**: Comprehensive documentation updates including new environment variables section

#### Testing:
- **`tests/test_integration.py`**: Updated to use `BEARTRAK_TEST_SERVER_PORT`

#### CI/CD:
- All GitHub Actions workflows already use port 8001 for development server consistently
- Python 3.13 was already included in the CI test matrix

### 3. Environment Variable Reference

Here's the complete list of environment variables now used by the project:

#### Core Configuration:
- `BEARTRAK_ENVIRONMENT`: Application environment (`development`, `production`, `test`)
- `BEARTRAK_DEBUG`: Enable debug/verbose logging
- `BEARTRAK_HOST`: Server host binding

#### Port Configuration:
- `BEARTRAK_PRODUCTION_PORT`: Production server port (default: 8000)
- `BEARTRAK_DEVELOPMENT_PORT`: Development server port (default: 8001)

#### Database Configuration:
- `BEARTRAK_PRODUCTION_DB`: Production database file (default: beartrak.db)
- `BEARTRAK_DEVELOPMENT_DB`: Development/test database file (default: beartrak_test.db)
- `BEARTRAK_DATABASE_URL`: Complete database URL override (optional)

#### CORS Configuration:
- `BEARTRAK_CORS_ORIGINS`: Allowed CORS origins (JSON array format)

#### Testing Configuration:
- `BEARTRAK_TEST_SERVER_PORT`: Port for integration tests (default: 8001)

### 4. Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Namespace Isolation**: All environment variables are now prefixed with `BEARTRAK_`, preventing conflicts with other projects
2. **Eliminated Generic Variables**: Removed the generic `PORT` variable which could cause confusion
3. **Clearer Intent**: Each variable now clearly indicates its purpose and scope
4. **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive environment variables section added to README
5. **Consistent Naming**: All variables follow the same naming convention
6. **Easier Debugging**: Variable names are self-documenting and project-specific

### 5. Migration Guide for Developers

If you have existing environment variables, update them as follows:

```bash
# Old .env file
ENVIRONMENT=development
PORT=8000
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./custom.db

# New .env file  
BEARTRAK_ENVIRONMENT=development
BEARTRAK_DEVELOPMENT_PORT=8001
BEARTRAK_PRODUCTION_PORT=8000
BEARTRAK_DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./custom.db
```

### 6. Testing Verification

All existing functionality has been preserved:
- ✅ 85 unit tests pass
- ✅ Type checking passes (mypy)
- ✅ Linting passes (ruff)
- ✅ Code formatting passes
- ✅ All Makefile targets work correctly
- ✅ CI/CD workflows remain functional

### 7. No Breaking Changes

This refactoring maintains backward compatibility for:
- All API endpoints remain the same
- Database behavior is unchanged
- Default port assignments are preserved
- All Makefile targets work as expected
- CI/CD workflows continue to function

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully isolates the BearTrak Search API's environment variables, eliminates potential conflicts with other projects, and provides a cleaner, more maintainable configuration system. All tests pass and the system maintains full backward compatibility.
